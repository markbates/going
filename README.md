# github.com/markbates/going

This project houses, what I consider to be some help packages for writing Go applications. Your mileage may vary, but I find them to be pretty darn helpful.

## Packages include

* [validate](./validate) - A framework for writing validations.
* [wait](./wait) - Wait cleans up the pattern around using `sync.WaitGroup`.
* [defaults](./defaults) - Allows for the setting of default values for common types.
